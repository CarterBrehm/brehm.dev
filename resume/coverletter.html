								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">September 5th, 2024</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">Professor Herbert Detloff & Professor Alisa Gilmore,</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Engineer position for the 2024-2025 Capstone Sequence. My name is Carter Brehm, and I am currently a Computer Engineering major at the University of Nebraska Omaha with industry experience in software development, problem-solving, and project management. I believe my skills and experiences align well with the needs of your organization, particularly designing and implementing software platforms for embedded systems.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">Throughout my professional journey, I have cultivated a deep understanding of software development lifecycles, from domain and software elements analysis to implementation and testing. My current role at Quantum Workplace as a Software Developer has enabled me to engage with software engineering methodologies, focusing on maintaining code readability, avoiding technical debt, and strict adherence to client requirements.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">My academic background further supports my qualifications for this role. As a recipient of the Walter Scott Jr. Scholarship, I am part of a rigorous program that emphasizes leadership development and design thinking. Working closely with USSTRATCOM and the DoD through the Scott Scholar Design Studio Internship, I gained valuable experience in performing requirements interviews, ideating solutions, and creating low-resolution prototypes to test assumptions.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">My internship at the UNO Center for Management of Information Technology provided me with the opportunity to develop an educational game in only 8 weeks using Unity and C#, employing agile IT development tools such as version control and pair programming. This experience underscores my ability to manage projects, work in shared development environments, and present progress updates in structured settings. This experience required meticulous requirements gathering, rapid prototyping, and thorough testing to ensure the end product met the defined objectives.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">My robust foundation in computer engineering, combined with my hands-on experience with software development in a wide array of languages and systems, provides me with a unique perspective and skill set that I am eager to an ECE capstone project. Particularly, I have been ideating with Dr. Andrew Harms on a drone platform centered around academic research, specifically for the students in his lab. Currently, they're working with sensors in the soil, but we believe we can expound on this need to design a reusable, standardized drone platform containing a multitude of sensors such as a GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. These sensors would abstract the operation and flight of the drone to an extensible control software, allowing for easy collection of data or experimentation.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed custom-coverletter">I've been looking into this further with Toby Heinemann, Xavier Herman, and Michael Maline due to our close proximity living together, prior experience working together, and shared membership in the scholarship program. I believe I can contribute effectively to this group, working only 17hrs/week for the year on other obligations such as my job and community action project. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and aspirations align with the needs of your organization.</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">Sincerely,</p>
								<p class="mt-2.1 text-md text-gray-700 leading-normal custom-coverletter">Carter Brehm</p>
